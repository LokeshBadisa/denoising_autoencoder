# denoising_autoencoder

-------------

---------------

This is a simple autoencoder based implementation for denoising images. For training, the dataset used in (DnCNN-Pytorch)[https://github.com/SaoYan/DnCNN-PyTorch] is used here too. Testing is done on Set12 and Set68 respectively.

Everything can be visualized in 'visualize.ipynb'. For training again, the train function can be utilized from 'utils.py'.
